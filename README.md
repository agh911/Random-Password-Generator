# Challenge 05 Intermediate JavaScript: Password Generator



## Description

For this project we were required to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that they have selected.

The application needed to check for the following: 
* Generate a password when the button is clicked.
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria:
    *  Length of password:
        * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    *  Character types:
        * Uppercase
        * Lowercase
        * Numeric
        * Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)
* Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
* Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
